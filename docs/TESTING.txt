OSDF Testing

Requirements
=====================================================================
  - Node.js 8.x or better
  - Mocha (installed via npm)
  - Chai (installed via npm)

Procedure
=====================================================================

1. Ensure that the mocha utility, and Chai, are installed and available on the
   command line. These are typically installed automatically with the npm utility
   because they are listed in the project's dependencies in the package.json
   file.

   # Installation of mocha and chai as a non-privileged/non-root user
   $ npm install

   # Installation of mocha system-wide as root (or with sudo)

   # npm install -g mocha 

      or

   $ sudo npm install -g mocha


2. Check that mocha is installed

   $ which mocha

   The 'which' command should report the location of the mocha utility. This
   should work when installing mocha-system wide however, if mocha was installed
   into the node_modules directory with npm, then you may need to add
   node_modules/.bin/ into your PATH and the OSDF root and lib directories to
   the NODE_PATH.

   # Adjusting the NODE_PATH (inside the root of the OSDF codebase).
   export NODE_PATH=.:./lib

3. Run the tests with gulp

   Gulp is a task runner and OSDF provides a gulpfile.js that makes
   invoking the mocha test suite simple by invoking mocha on your behalf.
   If gulp is globally available on your system:

   $ gulp test

   One can also use NPM to invoke the tests. The following will invoke
   gulp (which itself will invoke mocha) for you.
   
   $ npm test


4. Run the tests directly with mocha

   Once mocha is sucessfully installed, it affords greater flexibility
   and control than simply running the entire test suite with gulp. There
   may be times when a developer/user simply wishes to run a single test
   script, or even a single test case. For those tasks, it may be simpler
   to run mocha directly as follows:

   Running the whole test suite is accomplished with:

   $ mocha test

   Running an individual test script

   $ mocha test/node-retrieve.js

   Running an individual test case, or a subset of test cases, can be done
   with mocha's --grep option:

   $ mocha test/node-retrieve.js  --grep basic_retrieve_no_auth
